# Medibank Security Risk Assessment 🚀

## 📌 Overview
This project presents a **security risk assessment** for Medibank following its **2022 cyber breach**, with a structured **risk mitigation strategy** aligned with **ISO 27001, APRA CPS 234, and the Australian Privacy Act**.

The project includes:

✅ A **detailed risk register** identifying key security threats  
✅ **Mitigation strategies** to enhance Medibank’s security posture  
✅ A **Gantt chart** outlining a **realistic security implementation plan**  
✅ A **PowerPoint presentation** designed for **executive management**  
✅ A **video presentation** explaining findings & recommendations  

## 🔍 Key Findings
- **$50M+ in financial impact**, regulatory scrutiny, and reputational damage.
- Top **critical risks**: **Unauthorised access, phishing, insider threats, network weaknesses**.
